     * _Not to be confused with the `router` plugin._
     *
     * This method is an alternative to the `router` plugin. It allows you to
     * branch between different middleware per context object. You can pass two
     * things to it:
     * 1. A routing function
     * 2. Different middleware identified by key
     *
     * The routing function decides based on the context object which middleware
     * to run. Each middleware is identified by a key, so the routing function
     * simply returns the key of that middleware.
     * ```ts
     * // Define different route handlers
     * const routeHandlers = {
     *   evenUpdates: (ctx: Context) => { ... }
     *   oddUpdates: (ctx: Context) => { ... }
     * }
     * // Decide for a context object which one to pick
     * const router = (ctx: Context) => ctx.update.update_id % 2 === 0
     *   ? 'evenUpdates'
     *   : 'oddUpdates'
     * // Route it!
     * bot.route(router, routeHandlers)
     * ```
     *
     * Optionally, you can pass a third option that is used as fallback
     * middleware if your route function returns `undefined`, or if the key
     * returned by your router has no middleware associated with it.
     *
     * This method may need less setup than first instantiating a `Router`, but
     * for more complex setups, having a `Router` may be more readable.
     *
     * @param router The routing function to use
     * @param routeHandlers Handlers for every route
     * @param fallback Optional fallback middleware if no route matches

     * the given middleware. This allows you to install custom error handlers

     * out of this part of your middleware system, unless the supplied error
     * handler rethrows them, in which case the next surrounding error boundary
     * will catch the error.
     *

     * // Those will also be protected!
     * safe.on('message', middleware3)
     *
     * // No error from `middleware4` will reach the `errHandler` from above,
     * // as errors are suppressed.
     *
     * // do nothing on error (suppress error), and run outside middleware
     * const suppress = (_err: BotError, next: NextFunction) => { return next() }
     * safe.errorBoundary(suppress).on('edited_message', middleware4)
     * ```
